- **Download Music:** Users can download music from the selected music source for offline listening.
- **Authentication:** The application does not require authentication as it uses the music-api for accessing music sources.


## Usage
Upon opening Meuzik, you can start searching for songs. Clicking on a song will play it using the music-api and the selected music source. The progress bar allows you to track the current playing position, and you can adjust the playback speed as desired. Additionally, you can download music from the selected music source for offline listening.

## Important Note
Please note that playing music from YouTube Music may result in buffering due to the nature of the service. We recommend using other music sources such as Wync Music, Resso, Jio Saavn, Hungama Music, or Gaana for a smoother playback experience.
